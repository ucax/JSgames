# JSgames
A small collection of JS games i made back in 2022, they're not particularly well coded, but i want to keep them for memory.

# How to play

either clone the git or download it as zip and extract it anywhere, open the folder of the game that you wanna play and press on the "index.html".

# /Game/
contains a simple memory game (everything's in spanish) , pressing starts creates a grid of black squares, select the square that matches the word inside, you win by clicking on all the correct combinations, it even shows how long you took.

# /Game-2/
contains a snake game, fairly forward, you choose the difficulty and the size of the grid and you play by grabbing the red squares with the green snake, using your arrows keys to direct the fella, game ends once you either crash with yourself or with a wall, please note, this game can get a bit buggy.
